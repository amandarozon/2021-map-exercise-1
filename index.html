        The NYPDâ€™s announcement on new crime statistics revealed a growing percentage of gun arrests in the city are kids, dramatically up from last year.

According to New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea, 10% of people arrested for illegal guns are under 18, up from 1.8% last year. The announcement comes amid a rising number of reported guns in schools and a citywide effort to allocate metal detectors targeting schools deemed problem areas. 

21 guns were detected last week at the Urban Assembly School of Law and Justice after an incident involving a gun the previous day prompted the DOE to send a detector. A student shared on social media that some students bring guns because they feel unsafe when they leave school, Chalkbeat reporting. According to CompStat data, the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens saw significant increases in gun related incidents in November compared to November of last year.
